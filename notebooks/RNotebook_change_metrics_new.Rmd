### Changes Metrics With Method Rename Reffactoring

###Constraints:

* C1: Time series musthave a minimum number of peaks to be considered (median of length of ts)
* C2: The time series of changes must not be constant.
* C3: This constraint defines that the time series of changes must be stationary
* C4: This constraint defines that the time series of bugs must be stationary.

#####New Results:

```{r}
library(sqldf)
library(dplyr)

df <- sqldf(
  "SELECT Project, SUM(Count) as TotalTimeSeries, 
   SUM(CASE WHEN (P1 = 1)  THEN 1 ELSE 0 end) as 'C1',
   SUM(CASE WHEN (P1 = 1) AND (P4 = 1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 end) as 'C1-C2',

df$Perc <- round ((df$GrangerPos/df$`C1-C2-C3-C4`) * 100, 2)

```{r}
library(dplyr)

getPosGranger <- function (x) {
  if (x <= 0.05 && x != -1) {
    1
  } else {
    0
  }
}

getSatisfiedTs <- function (x, measure) {
  if (x >= measure) {

}))

#Pos Grangers
sm[, "GrangerPos"] <- 0
sm$Granger[is.na(sm$Granger)] <- -1
sm$GrangerPos <- mapply(getPosGranger, sm$Granger)

sm[, "P1"] <- 0
sm$P1 <- mapply(getSatisfiedTs, sm$lenghtTs, median(sm$lenghtTs))
```

###Analysis of Software Metrics:

* This table show the methods with positive granger by metrics.

```{r}
sm %>%
  group_by(Project, Metric) %>%
  summarise(GrangerPos = sum(GrangerPos))
```

###Constraints:

* C1: Time series musthave a minimum number of peaks to be considered (median of length of ts)
* C2: The time series of changes must not be constant.
* C3: This constraint defines that the time series of changes must be stationary
* C4: This constraint defines that the time series of bugs must be stationary.

* This table show the time series of projects along the constraints:

```{r}
sm[, "Count"] <- 1

dfsm <- sqldf(
  "SELECT Project, SUM(Count) as TotalTimeSeries, 
   SUM(CASE WHEN (P1 = 1)  THEN 1 ELSE 0 end) as 'C1',

   SUM(CASE WHEN (P1 = 1) AND (P4 = 1) AND (P5 = 1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 end) as 'C1-C2-C3',
   SUM(CASE WHEN (P1 = 1) AND (P4 = 1) AND (P3 = 1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 end) as 'C1-C2-C4',
   SUM(CASE WHEN (P1 = 1) AND (P4 = 1) AND (P3 = 1) AND (P5 = 1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 end) as 'C1-C2-C3-C4',
   SUM(CASE WHEN (P1 = 1) AND (P4 = 1) AND (P3 = 1) AND (P5 = 1) AND (GrangerPos = 1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 end) as 'C1-C4-Granger',
   SUM(CASE WHEN (GrangerPos = 1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 end) as 'Only-Granger'
   FROM sm
   GROUP BY Project"
)

dfsm$`Perc-C1-C4-Granger` <- round ((dfsm$`C1-C4-Granger`/dfsm$`C1-C2-C3-C4`) * 100, 2)
dfsm$`Perc-Only-Granger` <- round ((dfsm$`Only-Granger`/dfsm$TotalTimeSeries) * 100, 2)

dfsm <- dfsm[c(1:8, 10, 9, 11)]

```

* Low percentage of positives cases in projects Presto and Fresco due larger amount of erro: "series cannot be merged with non-unique index entries in a series"
* A small number of time series are stationary (C3-C4). The R functions that determine if a time series is stationary can be a threat? See the article: http://www.statosphere.com.au/check-time-series-stationary-r/
* A larger amount of time series is Constant (C1)
